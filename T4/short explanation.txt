In Meanshift we use probablity map to calculate the next point. 
The map from backprojection tells us where could be the right one, the denser it is, the higher probability it has. 
Meanshift is to shift the search window to the area of maximum pixel density. 
However, the object may move forwards or backwards, which means we should not use the same window size. 
So, CAMshift will update the window size every time in order to bound the moving object correctly.
